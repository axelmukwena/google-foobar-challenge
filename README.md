# Google Foobar Challenge

### Level 1:

#### Question 1: [Solar Doomsday](https://github.com/axelmukwena/google-foobar-challenge/blob/main/solar-doomsday.py)

File: `solar-doomsday.py`

Write a function solution(area) that takes as its input a single unit of measure representing the total area of solar panels you have (between 1 and 1000000 inclusive) and returns a list of the areas of the largest squares you could make out of those panels, starting with the largest squares first. So, following the example above, solution(12) would return [9, 1, 1, 1].


### Level 2:

#### Question 1: [Numbers Station Coded Messages](https://github.com/axelmukwena/google-foobar-challenge/blob/main/numbers-station-coded-messages.py)

File: `numbers-station-coded-messages.py`

Given a non-empty list of positive integers l and a target positive integer t, write a function solution(l, t) which verifies if there is at least one consecutive sequence of positive integers within the list l (i.e. a contiguous sub-list) that can be summed up to the given target positive integer t (the key) and returns the lexicographically smallest list containing the smallest start and end indexes where this sequence can be found, or returns the array [-1, -1] in the case that there is no such sequence (to throw off Lambda's spies, not all number broadcasts will contain a coded message).

#### Question 2: [Elevator Maintenance](https://github.com/axelmukwena/google-foobar-challenge/blob/main/elevator-maintenance.py)

File: `elevator-maintenance.py`

Given a list of elevator versions represented as strings, write a function solution(l) that returns the same list sorted in ascending order by major, minor, and revision number so that you can identify the current elevator version. The versions in list l will always contain major numbers, but minor and revision numbers are optional. If the version contains a revision number, then it will also have a minor number.
